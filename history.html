						<h2>Steve Jobs History</h2>
						<h3> Personal Life </h3>

					<content>
						<p>Steve Jobs was born on February 24, 1955, in the city of San Francisco. Job’s birth parents met at the University of Wisconsin,
						where his Syrian-born father, Abdulfattah John Jandali, taught, and where his mother Swiss-American Catholic Joanne Carole Schieble was a speech therapist.
						Shortly after the unwed couple gave jobs up for adoption, his biological parents married and had another child.</p>
						<p>Jobs biological mother (Joanne) insisted that the future parents of her boy be just as well educated. 
						Unfortunately, the candidates, Paul and Clara Jobs, did not meet her expectations: 
						they were a lower-middle class couple that had settled in the Bay Area after the war. 
						Paul was a machinist from the Midwest who had not even graduated from high school. 
						In the end, Joanne agreed to have her baby adopted by them, under the firm condition that they later send him to college.</p>
						<p>Paul and Clara called their son Steven Paul. While Steve was still a toddler, the couple moved to the Santa Clara County, 
						later to be known as Silicon Valley. They adopted another baby, a girl called Patti, three years later in 1958. 
						As a child Jobs and his father worked on electronics in the family garage, 
						his father showed him how to take apart and reconstruct electronic, a hobby that introduced confidence, 
						firmness and mechanical expertise in Steve Jobs.</p>
						<p>While Jobs was always an intelligent and innovative thinker, he was quite a turbulent child, 
						and his youth was riddled with frustrations over formal schooling. Jobs was a prankster in elementary school due to boredom, 
						and his fourth-grade teacher needed to bribe him to study. 
						One day he came home and declared that if he wasn’t transferred to another school, he would stop going to school altogether. 
						He was 11. Paul and Clara complied, and the Jobses moved to the cozier city of Los Altos, so that Steve could go to Cupertino Junior High. 
						This proved to be decisive for Steve’s future.</p>

						<p>A couple of years later, while jobs was enrolled at Homestead High School, he was introduced to his future partner Steve Wozniak, 
						who was attending the University of California, Berkely. In 1 2007 interview with PC World, Wozniak spoke about why he and jobs clicked so well:</p>
						<blockquote>”We both loved electronics and the way we used to hook up digital chips,
						" Wozniak said. "Very few people, especially back then, had any idea what chips were, how they worked and what they could do. 
						I had designed many computers, so I was way ahead of him in electronics and computer design, but we still had common interests.
						We both had pretty much sort of an independent attitude about things in the world. ..."</blockquote>
