Description of site design
Purpose of the Website
The purpose of the Web page I designed was to showcase the life and work of someone I consider a personal hero. I went on the choose “Steve Jobs”. The website is designed in a way which not only talks about his personal life but also showcases his life’s achievements.
Design of Website
As per the design of the website I had to make sure it was designed and presented according to the features that needed to be shown on the website. In the end I managed to reach the goal I had set for my website and anyone viewing the website will be able to find the following information:
 A short personal Biography
 Details about the personal life of my hero
 Details about their life’s work and achievements
 Details about why I chose him and there influence on me
 Links to relevant sites that relate to my hero
 Media relating to my hero
Presentation of Website
The Homepage will set the look of the website. I started off with designing the Homepage of the website and I made a decision to use a slideshow, showing certain images of my hero which illustrates who and what the website is about. This meant the homepage would not only be easy to understand but it would contain a minimal amount of text and each image was describing the hero in a different way.
The horizontal navigation bar along the top of the page is spread out across the entire page, I used an appropriate colour schemes for the background and font colour which makes it easy to read and I’ve included a hover colour so it’s easy to see which page is being clicked on, within the navigation. As per the other pages in the website, I decided to fix the navigation bar as it would make browsing the website easier. Having the main navigation bar at your immediate disposal makes it quick and easy to get through to different pages in the website especially if some pages have a lot of information where you have to scroll down.
I’ve divided the pages into different sections so the text is evenly distributed and its makes it easier to read. The page has been divided into separate text boxes, some pages will have two separate boxes that evenly distribute the text, but every page consist of a sidebar. The sidebar doesn’t consist of the main content, it only consists of secondary content related to my hero but it allows you from a click of a bottom to redirect to another page to read all the content in the sidebar. It’s easy to navigate around the website with all the content appropriately spread out. The media used on the website will mainly be related to the life achievements of my hero.

Colour Scheme
The colour scheme for this web site should promote a professional appearance. The background on all pages is a light grey/blue graphite texture. The text will be black with dark orange links that will go well with the hover colour over the grey navigation bars at the top. All media will visually integrate with the web page and will compliment it.
